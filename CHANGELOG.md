# CHANGELOG

## 0.2.6
* bugfix: move focus-options-polyfill from devDependencies to dependencies

## 0.2.5
* Parallax: refactor scrollTop to be more DRY
* Parallax: refactor layers array to a set
* ParallaxLayers: now delete themselves from layers set on unmount. This also means ParallaxLayers can now be dynamically added and removed
* Parallax: moved layer.setHeight calls from setDimensions to their own reactive statement (so layer reactivity isn't dependent on resizing)
* Parallax: reduced setTimeout of resize callback to 0

## 0.2.4
* refactor: get rid of $ready flag and change innerHeight from a store to a regular prop and reorganize

## 0.2.3
* bugfix: add missing $ to ready flag in ParallaxLayer

## 0.2.2
* very small refactors, no functionality changed

## 0.2.1
REFACTOR:
  * make Parallax and ParallaxLayer a little less tightly coupled
  * ParallaxLayer registers itself with Parallax in onMount
  * Parallax now calls all position and height update functions for each ParallaxLayer

## 0.2.0
* BREAKING CHANGE: remove horizontal prop from ParallaxLayer. I don't think it works well without additional parameters passed from the user and I want to keep the API minimal (atleast at first). Plus, I'd rather have fewer features at release than have something that doesn't work right and have to remove/change it after.
* BREAKING CHANGE: remove SimpleParallax from the package. If someone really wants that particular component you can always copy it from a previous version.

## 0.1.13
* bugfix: change 'keyup' to 'keydown' in abortEvents listener list in scrollTo. 'keyup' was interfering with the click listener to start the animation if it was started by pressing the enter key. 

## 0.1.12
* reduce default duration of scrollTo

## 0.1.11
* bugfix: scroll animation is now cancellable when user scrolls or clicks
* add temporary fork of svelte-scrollto until PR is merged

## 0.1.10
* DEPRECATED: SimpleParallax is deprecated moving forward. I realized you can do the same effect easily with Parallax/ParallaxLayer so I'm adding it to the new Recipes section of the README. I'll keep the component in the package with a notice for awhile.
* add Recipes section to README
* Parallax: refactor intersecting calculations to just use scrollTop store
* ParallaxLayer: refactor out unneeded checks because of Parallax refactor

## 0.1.9
* bugfix: disabled works correctly now
* refactored a few more things in ParallaxLayer

## 0.1.8
* refactor: ParallaxLayer initialization
* add vendor prefixes for transform rules
* rename SimpleParallax class names to avoid clashing with Parallax/ParallaxLayer
* bugfix: SimpleParallax initial and disabled positions are now correct

## 0.1.7
* typo in README

## 0.1.6
* move focus-options-polyfill to devDependency
* refactor scrollTo to use svelte-scrollto
* BREAKING CHANGE: change the second parameter of scrollTo function from string to options object
* update README to reflect breaking change

## 0.1.5
* refactoring: change initialization of ParallaxLayer to depend on container being mounted
* feature: add onExit prop to Parallax

## 0.1.4
* bugfix: fix onEnter
* bugfix: correct initial position of ParallaxLayers

## 0.1.3
* bugfix: add correct Y-coordinate for ParallaxLayer when effect is disabled

* add CHANGELOG

## 0.1.1
* add basic demo to README
* remove unused utils

## 0.1.0
* initial commit
