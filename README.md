# svelte-parallax

A spring-based parallax component for Svelte. (Well, it's actually two components.)

**NOTE**: This is at 0.4.x and I'm still working on stuff. Something could break and while I'm not *trying* to remove anything from the API it's still a possibility (I'll post a deprecation notice first instead of outright yanking something). If anything is weird, open an issue and let me know!

**DEPRECATED**: From v0.3.0 on, `onEnter` and `onExit` are being replaced with `threshold`. See [Parallax](#parallax) and [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kindoflew/svelte-parallax/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## svelte-parallax
This package is based on [react-spring/parallax](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring/tree/master/packages/parallax).
The API is very similar and it functions (mostly) the same under the hood (See [differences](#differences-from-react-spring/parallax) between them).

<br/>

[Play with a basic demo here](https://svelte.dev/repl/917289a96f564f3788dcb6400f44a8bc?version=3.37.0)

<br/>

The `<Parallax>` component is a container whose height will be the number of `sections` you choose multiplied by the `sectionHeight` (defaults to `window.innerHeight`, which should be good for most use cases). `<ParallaxLayer>` components contain anything you want to be affected and are nested inside `<Parallax>`. A simple set-up may look like this:

```html
<script>
  import { Parallax, ParallaxLayer } from 'svelte-parallax';
</script>

<Parallax sections={3} config={{stiffness: 0.2, damping: 0.3}}>
  <ParallaxLayer rate={0} span={3} style={"background-color: orange;"} />

  <ParallaxLayer rate={-0.5} offset={1}>
    <img src='horse.jpg' alt='a horse'>
  </ParallaxLayer>

  <ParallaxLayer rate={1} offset={1.75}>
    <img src='bird.jpg' alt='a bird'>
  </ParallaxLayer>

  <ParallaxLayer rate={2} offset={2} style={"background-color: lightblue;"} />
</Parallax>
```

<br/>

### `<Parallax>`

| Props            | Type     | Default                               |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `sections`       | number   | `1`                                   |
| `sectionHeight`  | number   | `window.innerHeight`                  |
| `config`         | object   | `{ stiffness: 0.017, damping: 0.26 }` |
| `threshold`      | object   | `{ top: 1, bottom: 1 }`               |
| `onProgress`     | function | `undefined`                           |
| `disabled`       | boolean  | `false`                               |
| `style`          | string   | `""`                                  |


#### Details
* `sections`: How many sections the container has.

* `sectionHeight`: The height of an individual section. Defaults to `window.innerHeight`, using Svelte's `bind:innerHeight`.

* `config`: Optional [Svelte spring store](https://svelte.dev/docs#spring) configuration, if you want more control over parallax physics.

* `threshold`: Adds a threshold above/below `Parallax` that is equal to the height of the viewport multiplied by the value, each one should be a number between `0` and `1`. `threshold.top = 1`: the effect will be active whenever the top of the container is at or above the *top* of the viewport, `threshold.top = 0`: effect will be active whenever the top of the container is at or above the *bottom* of the viewport. `threshold.bottom` is similar, but on the other end -- `1`: active when bottom of container is at or below the *bottom* of the viewport, `0`: active when bottom is at or below the *top* of the viewport.

* `onProgress`: Takes a function that recieves a `progress` object (See below).

* `disabled`: Whether or not the effect is disabled (for a11y, etc. see [Prefers-reduced-motion](#prefers-reduced-motion)). When `disabled = true`, layers will stay at their target positions.

* `style`: The `style` attribute of the container is exposed so you can do pretty much whatever you want. Messing with `height`, `position` or `overflow` *might* break stuff, but you do you.

##### `onProgress`

| Property              | Type   |
| --------------------- | ------ |
| `parallaxProgress`    | float  |
| `section`             | number |
| `sectionProgress`     | float  |

* `parallaxProgress`: Represents the progress of the entire `Parallax` container scrolled, represented as a float between `0` and `1`. Starts at `0` when the top of the `Parallax` container is at the top of the viewport, ends at `1` when the bottom of the `Parallax` container is at the bottom of the viewport.

* `section`: the number of the current section

* `sectionProgress`: Represents the scroll progress of the current `section`, represented as a float between `0` and `1`. Starts at `0` when the top of the `section` is at the top of the viewport, ends at `1` when the bottom of the `section` is at the top of the viewport (**NOTE**: not the same behavior as `parallaxProgress`).

**Example Usage**:

```HTML
<script>
  import { Parallax, ParallaxLayer } from 'svelte-parallax';

  // for bind:this. name can be anything
  let parallax;

  let rotate;
  let percentScrolled;

  const handleProgress = (progress) => {
    const { parallaxProgress, section, sectionProgress } = progress;

    if (section === 2) {
      rotate = sectionProgress * 360;
    }
    percentScrolled = Math.floor(parallaxProgress * 100);
  };
</script>
<h1 style="position: fixed;">
  {perecentScrolled}% scrolled so far!
</h1>
                    <!-- bind to component instance -->
<Parallax sections={3} bind:this={parallax} onProgress={handleProgress}>
  <ParallaxLayer offset={1} style={`transform: rotate(${rotate})`} />
  ...
</Parallax>
```



<br/>

### `<ParallaxLayer>`

| Props           | Type    | Default |
| --------------- | ------- | ------- |
| `rate`          | number  | `0.5`   |
| `offset`        | number  | `0`     |
| `span`          | number  | `1`     |
| `style`         | string  | `""`    |


#### Details
* `rate`: Rate the layer will scroll relative to `scrollY`. Can be positive or negative: positive will translate the layer up and negative, down. `0` will scroll normally.

* `offset`: Offset from the top of the container when the layer's section completely fills the viewport. Can be a float (`0.5` will place the layer halfway down the first section when the first section takes up the whole viewport).

* `span`: How many innerHeight-sized sections the layer will span.

* `style`: Style attribute is also exposed for this component.

<br/>

### `scrollTo`
Rather than have a click listener on an entire `<ParallaxLayer>` (which I think is bad for a11y because a page sized `<div>` probably shouldn't be a button), `<Parallax>` exports a `scrollTo` function for click-to-scroll so you can use semantic HTML. It takes a little set-up because of this, but I believe the benefits outweigh a little boilerplate. 

`scrollTo` uses a fork of [svelte-scrollto](https://github.com/langbamit/svelte-scrollto) to animate scrolling, instead of relying on the native browser implementation. Because of this, you can have smooth, custom scrolling regardless of browser support for `scroll-behavior`.


| Parameters          | Type   | Description                     |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| `section`           | number | The section to scroll to        |
| `config` (optional) | object | Scroll animation config options |  


<br/>

#### `config` object:
| Key        | Type     | Description                                      | Default     |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| `selector` | string   | CSS selector of element to focus on after scroll | `""`        |
| `duration` | number   | Duration of scroll in milliseconds               | `500`       |
| `easing`   | function | Easing function (import from 'svelte/easing')    | `quadInOut` |

<br/>

Example setup:

```HTML
<script>
  import { Parallax, ParallaxLayer } from 'svelte-parallax';

  // for bind:this. name can be anything
  let parallax;
</script>
                    <!-- bind to component instance -->
<Parallax sections={2} bind:this={parallax}>

  <ParallaxLayer>
                      <!-- function is a method on component instance -->
    <button 
      class='horse-btn' 
      on:click={() => parallax.scrollTo(2, { selector: '.top-btn', duration: 2000 })}
    >
      Scroll to horse
    </button>
  </ParallaxLayer>

  <ParallaxLayer offset={1}>
    <img src='horse.jpg' alt='a horse'>
    <button 
      class="top-btn" 
      on:click={() => parallax.scrollTo(1, { selector: '.horse-btn', duration: 1000 })}
    >
      Scroll to top
    </button>
  </ParallaxLayer>
</Parallax>
```

If you *really* need to use something besides buttons for `scrollTo` make sure to address `tabindex`, focus-style, and `keyup`/`keydown` events (More best practices at [MDN - ARIA: button role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/button_role)).

<br/>

### Tips
* `rate`: The `rate` prop will affect the initial position of `<ParallaxLayer>` because of the way the motion formulas work. A suggested workflow would be intially setting `disabled=true` on `<Parallax>` and placing content where you want it to *end up*. After that, remove `disabled` and then tweak rate and style until the motion is how you'd like it.

* `z-index`: `<ParallaxLayer>`s are absolutely positioned so they are organized on the z-axis in the order they are written in the HTML. If you don't want to mess with z-index (and who does?) make sure to place all content that should always be visible/clickable towards the bottom of `<Parallax>`. y-axis order is unaffected by this because that is decided by `offset`.

* `will-change`: I decided not to set `will-change: transform` on every `<ParallaxLayer>` because you quickly hit a memory limit (atleast in Firefox) and [it's not recommended anyways](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/will-change). If you have performance issues, this can be added as necessary to the `style` prop.

* `scrollY`: svelte-parallax uses Svelte's `bind:scrollY` in its motion functions, so it will not work if placed inside a scrollable element (like a `div` with `overflow: scroll`). I don't have plans to change this right now, but if enough people ask for it, who knows?

<br/>

### Differences from react-spring/parallax
* Some of the prop names are changed for no reason other than that I like them more. If you are coming from react, `span = factor`, `sections = pages`, `rate = speed`.

* react-spring/parallax is a scrollable container, svelte-parallax is not (you are scrolling the actual page). This means that svelte-parallax can be anywhere on the page and also that the only scrollbar will be the browser's.

* react-spring/parallax has a `horizontal` prop on the container component, svelte-parallax does not. This is mostly because of the point mentioned above — this is not a scrollable container, so you'd have to scroll the actual browser window horizontally, which is gross to me.

* react-spring/parallax has a `sticky` prop on `ParallaxLayer` (that I implemented!), svelte-parallax does not. I'm working on bringing it here too, but it's tricky because CSS hates fun.


All that being said, I'd like to thank anyone and everyone who made react-spring/parallax, without whom this package would not exist.

## Recipes

### Prefers-reduced-motion

Parallax effects can be jarring for those sensitive to too much visual motion. Browsers expose information about whether or not your user prefers reduced motion. You can use something like this to dynamically disable the effect for those users:

```html
<script>
  import { Parallax, ParallaxLayer } from 'svelte-parallax';

  let prefersReducedMotion = window.matchMedia("(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)").matches;
</script>

<Parallax disabled={prefersReducedMotion}>
  <!-- your stuff here -->
</Parallax>
```

**NOTE**: For SvelteKit/Sapper with SSR you'd have to do that in `onMount` or behind an `if (process.browser)` or `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')` check.

<br/>

### Squarespace-style

For simple, no-frills parallax effects, you can set `stiffness` and `damping` to `1` which will cancel out the spring effect, and then set `threshold` properties to `0` so the effect will be enabled whenever the container is in the viewport.

```html
<Parallax 
  config={{ stiffness: 1, damping: 1 }} 
  threshold={{ top: 0, bottom: 0 }} 
  sections={1}
>
  <ParallaxLayer rate={-0.4}>
    <img 
      src="horse.jpg"
      alt="a horse"
    />
  </ParallaxLayer>
</Parallax>
```


You could even have multiple parallaxing layers with static divs in between like this:

```html
<Parallax 
  config={{ stiffness: 1, damping: 1 }} 
  threshold={{ top: 0, bottom: 0 }} 
  sections={3}
>
  <ParallaxLayer rate={-0.4}>
    <img 
      src="horse.jpg"
      alt="a horse"
    />
  </ParallaxLayer>
  <ParallaxLayer rate={-0.4} offset={2}>
    <img 
      src="bird.jpg"
      alt="a bird"
    />
  </ParallaxLayer>
       <!-- Rate is 0, offset is between the two parallaxing layers above -->
  <ParallaxLayer rate={0} offset={1} style={"background-color:lightblue;"} />
</Parallax>
```

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! I'm keeping everything in JavaScript for now and I've tried to comment a lot to make jumping in easier. There really isn't a whole lot to the JavaScript parts so that helps too.

To work locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kindoflew/svelte-parallax
cd svelte-parallax
npm install
# if you want to use the demo app
cd demo
npm install
npm run dev # can also be run from root folder once installed
```

This will run a dev server on localhost:5000. The source lives in `src` and `demo` is there for live feedback while working.

Things I Probably Need:

* **Optimzations**: Didn't want to optimize in advance (YAGNI and Svelte takes care of a lot of it already), but I did notice that on mobile any `<ParallaxLayer>` that has only a `background-image` (no nested content) and a `rate` other than `0` will flicker until it stops moving. Only tested on an iPhone7 and iPhone8 so far. Also, note that `will-change: transform` has had no effect. Don't know much about rendering optimizations, so I'm open to any suggestions!
